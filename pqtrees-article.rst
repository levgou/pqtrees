Let the pattern :math:`P = p_1 , ... , p_m`
and the string :math:`S = s_1, s_2,...,s_n` be both sequences of characters (with possible repeats) over
a given alphabet  (in our case genes). P appears in location i in S iff
:math:`(p_1, p_2,...,p_m)` is a permutation of :math:`(s_i, s_{i+1},...,s_{i+mâˆ’1})`.
